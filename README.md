# Lighthouse UI
A Customizable and Modular Components Library for React Native apps.
This library was inspired on the [Shoutem UI](https://github.com/shoutem/ui/) and adapted to the Lighthouse's developer team ecosystem.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save @lighthouseit/ui
$ react-native link @lighthouseit/ui # No need to run this with CRNA / Expo apps
```

## Examples

To see how Lighthouse UI works, you can:

- Run the `example` directly on your Expo Client by the link: [https://exp.host/@donnes/lighthouseui](https://exp.host/@donnes/lighthouseui)
- Clone this repo. `cd example` then `npm install` and finally run `exp start`

## To Do

- [ ] Add more examples
